Help bring Meower to more platforms!

## Why make a client for Meower Everywhere?

You'll get
1.  A mwr4(device).atticat.tech subdomain (hopefully (device).mwreverywhere.cc in the future) for your client (can be used for the client itself, documentation or just the readme of your client's GitHub repository)
2.  Developer role on the Discord server 
3.  A channel for your device on the Discord server to post updates related to the client
4.  Recognition on the GitHub organisation readme
5.  Access to other work in progress clients in the meower everywhere GitHub organisation

You'll have full control over your client, and you can request it to be transferred to your personal account* or make the code private during development at any time!

## Are there any requirements?

When creating a client, we've got a checklist of essential Meower client features. You don't have to add all the features, but the closer to 100% completion of the feature checklist the better.
